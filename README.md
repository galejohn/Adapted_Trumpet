# Adapted_Trumpet
This adapted trumpet project uses fast servos (typically used for RC model helicopter tail rotors and RC model car steering) to push the valves on the trumpet. These servos are lighter and use much less power than solenoids.

Because we had several On Track Academy students working with the Adafruit Circuit Playground Express (CPX) board in MakeCode, we used that board, along with a Crickit, for this project.

See Wiki for more information.
